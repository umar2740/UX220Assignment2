### Brantford Christmas parade

Last school year, one of my fondest memories is of Brantford's Winter/Christmas parade. Since this took place across Dalhousie street, my house had a clear, elevated view of the entire festival. My roommates and I set up comfy lawn chairs on the porch and got snacks and hot chocolate from Tim Hortons. Local families, residents, and fellow students were all united and filled up the entire sidewalk on either side to enjoy the festivities.
